# OOP Supermarket ðŸ›’

This is a small **Java Swing supermarket management system** I made as my **semester project** for my OOP course.

Itâ€™s basically a desktop app where you can manage products, categories, employees, customers, and even do billing â€” all wrapped up in a GUI made with Swing.
